# My Very First Website
---

## Welcome!

### This is my starting project on my course to becoming a full stack developer.

#### In this project i have included a basic web page with links to two other web pages via the stream-two and stream-three headings.

##### On each of these web pages i have included images and wikipedia links to all of the programs that i will be using during my course.

###### While making this project i have been using programs for certain things and i will list each of these below
- HTML5 was used to write the fundamentals of the web page.
- CSS was used to add colour and sizing of my code.
- Cloud9 was used as the base for which to hold my HTML5 and CSS and to preview the work as i write it.
- Git was used to store my code in a local repository and allowed me to work with the files to ready them for github.
- GitHub was used to store my code on a remote repository that allows others to help contribute to my code.

###### Thank you for reading.
